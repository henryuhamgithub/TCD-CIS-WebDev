    <h2>Basic Information and History</h2>
    <div>
      <p><b>Guilty Gear</b> is a series of 2D fighting games created by Arc System Works for various consoles such as PC, Nintendo switch, Xbox, and Playstation. The games feature complex combo move and combat mechanisms along with vibrant anime-style art and music created by designer and composer <b>Daisuke Ishiwatare</b>. The game's style often makes reference to American hard rock and heavy metal music scenes and most of the character and menu themes in the games take direct inspiration, having a very heavy, driving feel. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The series has gained a lot of popularity within the fighting game community, and along with the main games, a number of spinoffs, novels, manga, and 'Drama CDs', which are radio dramas about the game's story in CD form. The story of the <b>Guilty Gear</b> series is massive, with each individual game having a story mode that contributes to the overarching narrative. The most recent game, <i>Guilty Gear -Strive-</i>, has a full-length movie rather than a story mode and contains an extensive glossary and plot timeline covering all the main characters, groups, and plot events. </p>

      <h3>List of all Games</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> The first Guilty Gear game, simply titled <b><i>Guilty Gear</i></b>, released in 1998 for playstation and had a more basic version of the mechanics seen in newer games. Some of the characters change in later games, but the main cast is all here, even if with more basic designs.<br><img src="https://github.com/henryuhamgithub/TCD-CIS-WebDev/blob/main/module03/images/gg1.png" alt ="Guilty gear cover art" height="250"></li>
        <li><b><i>Guilty Gear X</i></b>, the second installment in the series, was originally released for Sega's NAOMI arcade system, but got a Dreamcast port as well in Japan. Some more mechanics are added, and some new characters join the mix, but other than that, <b><i>Guilty Gear X</i></b> is just a sequel to the first game. It also had a few revisions (<b><i>Guilty Gear X Plus</i></b>, <b><i>Guilty Gear X Advance Edition</i></b>, and <b><i>Guilty Gear X ver 1.5</i></b>) that added new characters and features and brought the game to new systems.<br><img src="https://github.com/henryuhamgithub/TCD-CIS-WebDev/blob/main/module03/images/GuiltyGearXCover.jpg" alt= "guilty gear X cover art" height="250"></li>
        <li>The next game in the series, known as <b><i>Guilty Gear XX: The Midnight Carnival</i></b> in Japan and <b><i> Guilty gear X2</i></b> everywhere else, expands further upon gameplay and adds a few new characters. It also picks up right where <b><i>X</i></b> left off, taking place in the story only a week after the previous game ended. <br><img src="https://github.com/henryuhamgithub/TCD-CIS-WebDev/blob/main/module03/images/Guilty_Gear_XX_PS2_JP.jpg" alt= "guilty gear xx cover art" height="250"><br><b><i>Guilty Gear XX</i></b> also has a number of revisions. In order, they are:<ul>
            <li><b><i>Guilty Gear XX &#9839;Reload</i></b></li>
            <li><b><i>Guilty Gear XX Slash</i></b></li>
            <li><b><i>Guilty Gear XX &lambda; Core</i></b></li>
            <li><b><i>Guilty Gear XX &lambda; Core Plus</i></b></li>
            <li><b><i>Guilty Gear XX &lambda; Core Plus R</i></b><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henryuhamgithub/TCD-CIS-WebDev/refs/heads/main/module03/images/ggxxac.jfif" alt= "Guilty Gear accent core cover art"></li>
          </ul>
        <li>The next main game in the series, which came out before <b><i>&lambda; Core Plus</i></b>, is called <b><i>Guilty Gear 2 -Overture-</i></b> and branches out gameplay-wise, being classified by Daisuke Ishiwatari as "Melee Action". It retains special moves, characters, and animations from previous entries in the series, but is the first to incorporate 3D graphics and RTS (<i>real-time strategy</i>) elements in gameplay. It doesn't have any other releases or revisions since the gameplay strayed from what had gotten the series success in the past.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henryuhamgithub/TCD-CIS-WebDev/refs/heads/main/module03/images/gg2overture.jfif" alt="guilty gear 2 overture cover art" height = "250"></li>
        <li>After the departure from what most fans expected coming from <b><i>Overture</i></b>, the next game, <b><i>Guilty Gear Xrd -Sign-</i></b>, follows the original formula more closely and expands even further on the classic mechanics and provides more background to the story, focusing on how the world of <i>Guilty Gear</i> became what it is. it also uses 3D graphics that will go on to become, stylistically, the aesthetic the series lives in today.<br><img src="https://github.com/henryuhamgithub/TCD-CIS-WebDev/blob/main/module03/images/ggxrdsign.jpg" "guilty gear xrd sign cover art" height="250"</li>
        <li>While the next game keeps the same name, it isn't actually a revision and stands as its own game. <b><i>Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator-</i></b>, the next entry in the series, uses the same 3D graphics, adds a few new mechanics, brings back some old and new characters, and adds Digital Figure Mode, which lets players use in-game 3D assets and environments to create dioramas, using the characters' models like action figures. <b><i>-Revelator-</i></b> has one revision, titled <b><i>Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2</i></b>. It adds more story to the base game and contains various other small changes like redesigning the HUD. <br><img src="https://github.com/henryuhamgithub/TCD-CIS-WebDev/blob/main/module03/images/ggxrdrev.png" alt ="guilty gear xrd revelator cover art" height="300"></li>
        <li>The most recent main entry in the series, <b><i>Guilty Gear -Strive-</i></b>, adds more characters, mechanics, and gamemodes, featuring an active online scene and the recent <i>Team of 3</i> mode, that lets two three-person teams battle by tagging one character in to fight in normal gameplay, while the other two use abilities such as healing and summoning items to help.<br><img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henryuhamgithub/TCD-CIS-WebDev/refs/heads/main/module03/images/ggst.jfif" alt="guilty gear strive cover art"></li>
